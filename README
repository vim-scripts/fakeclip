*fakeclip* is a Vim plugin to provide a pseudo |clipboard| register for
several versions of Vim without |+clipboard| support, especially for non-GUI
version of Vim on the following platforms:

- Cygwin
- Mac OS X
- X Window System (by xclip <http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/&gt;)


fakeclip also provides a pseudo register to access a "paste buffer" if one of
the following applications is available:

- GNU screen
- tmux


FAQ: If you can't copy/paste multibyte characters with the clipboard
     on Mac OS X, see |fakeclip-multibyte-on-mac|.

Note for Mac OS users: Though Vim supports clipboard for the console version
since version 7.3, fakeclip is still useful to access a "paste buffer".


Requirements:
- Vim 7.0 or later
